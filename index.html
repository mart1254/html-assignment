        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello! I'm Dominic Martin. <br> 
        I was born on September<sup>3rd</sup>, 2000  and I am originally from 
        Aylmer, Gatineau, <abbr title="QuÃ©bec">QC.</abbr> I moved to Ontario 
        around 2011 and have since stayed in Ottawa and currently live in
        Nepean on the same street as the IKEA.</p>


        <p>I enrolled in Interactive Media Design because I had originally took the Journalism 
        course here at Algonquin and really enjoyed the technical aspects of the program but not
        so much the actual Journalism part, and was recommended 
        <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> by the program coordinator, but wanted to
        try my hand at Computer Programming first because at the time I didn't really consider myself 
        a design person. I enrolled into Computer Programming but failed Math <em>twice</em> -not a
        a math person- and finally enrolled in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>
        and I'm loving it!</p>


        <p>Here are two of my favourite hobbies!</p>

        <ul>
            <li>History</li>
            <li>Biking</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <p>Due to my previous endeavours, I am reminded of a quote from one of my favourite Sci-Fi
        series:</p>

        <blockquote style="color:rgb(48, 48, 248);">It is possible to commit no errors and still lose. 
        That is not a weakness. That is life. -
        <cite>Captain Jean-Luc Picard</cite></blockquote>
